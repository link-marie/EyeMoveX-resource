    <h2>Note:</h2>
    <p>This information is not intended to be a substitute for professional
      advice.<br>
      Hoping this for you to understand EMDR and work with a professional
      therapist to make an informed choice about whether EMDR therapy is good
      for you.</p>
    <h2>What is EMDR?</h2>
    <p>EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing) is one of trauma
      therapies.<br>
      <br>
      While using rapid eye movements to facilitate the process, EMDR involves </p>
    <ol>
    </ol>
    &nbsp; 1. “recalling” a stressful past event and <br>
    &nbsp; 2. “reprogramming” the memory.<br>
    <br>
    EMDR is developed by psychologist Dr. Francine Shapiro.<br>
    When she strolled through a park one day, she noticed her own stress
    reactions diminished when her eyes swept back and forth.<br>
    <p> Eye movements can reduce the intensity of the disturbing thoughts.<br>
      <br>
      Why EMDR works are still evolving.<br>
      However many people have found EMDR to be extremely beneficial. <br>
      Learn about this complex and often misunderstood therapy.</p>
    <h2>EMDR therapy 8 phases</h2>
    <p>One standard session of EMDR therapy is consisted from 8 phases.<br>
      EMDR therapy contains several sessions including eye movements of
      bilateral or other forms of rhythmic, left-right stimulation. (in Phase 4,
      5 and 6)</p>
    <p>Phase 1: History and Planning<br>
      Phase 2: Preparation<br>
      Phase 3: Assessment<br>
      Phase 4: Desensitization<br>
      Phase 5: Installation<br>
      Phase 6: Body Scan<br>
      Phase 7: Closure<br>
      Phase 8: Reevaluation<br>
    </p>
    EMDR often helps people feel better very quickly.<br>
    <p> Note that it is important to work through the entire 8-phase process
      with a qualified EMDR therapist to ensure the most beneficial, lasting
      results.<br>
      <br>
      One of the key points of EMDR is “dual stimulation”.</p>
    <ol>
    </ol>
    &nbsp; 1. While focusing on moving object of bilateral stimuli,<br>
    &nbsp; 2. You imagine or talk about memories, triggers, and painful
    emotions.
    <p>Other forms of external stimuli that may be used.<br>
      For example, alternating hand taps or sound that pans back and forth from
      ear to ear.</p>
    <h2>What is EMDR principle?</h2>
    <p>A traumatic event becomes “frozen in time”.<br>
      Because strong emotions interfere with our ability to process the
      experience.<br>
      <br>
      You may feel as if you are reliving the event all over again by just
      recalling the traumatic event.<br>
      Because the image, feelings, sound, five senses are still there and come
      back in the present.<br>
      Once the event was re-activated, the memories cause a negative effect on</p>
    <ul>
    </ul>
    &nbsp; - our daily living<br>
    &nbsp; - our visions<br>
    &nbsp; - our world<br>
    &nbsp; - our relation to others.<br>
    <p> EMDR therapy appears to directly affect the brain.<br>
      It enables “unfreezing” the traumatic memories, allowing you to resolve
      them.<br>
      <br>
      EMDR therapy is iterated the traumatic memory (and associated beliefs /
      feelings / sensations) is digested until you are able to think about the
      event without reliving it. <br>
      <br>
      The memory is still there, but it is less disturbing.<br>
      <br>
      The exact mechanism for the effectiveness of EMDR is yet unknown. <br>
      <br>
      It appears that using rapid eye movements relieves the anxiety associated
      with the trauma.<br>
      The traumatic event can be examined from a more detached perspective,
      somewhat like watching a movie.<br>
      <br>
      This enables you to access positive ways of re-framing the traumatic event
      (<u>reprocessing</u>),<br>
      and to release the body’s stored negative emotional charges around it (<u>desensitization</u>).<br>
      <br>
      Some professionals say the eye movements in EMDR might be similar to REM
      (rapid eye movement)&nbsp; what occurs naturally during dreaming or sleep.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2>Trapped by Memories:</h2>
    <h4>How a single trauma can impact our lives</h4>
    <p>Francine Shapiro, the creator of EMDR, uses the example of a rape
      survivor to illustrate how people can get “trapped” by memories of
      trauma.&nbsp; While a woman who has been raped might intellectually know
      that she’s not to blame, but she still may feel emotions of guilt and
      shame surrounding the attack.&nbsp; Her memory of the rape is then forever
      affected by these emotions, which she hasn’t fully explored or dealt with.
      Shapiro believes that as time goes by, “when the individual thinks about
      the trauma, or when the memory is triggered by similar situations, the
      person may feel like she is reliving it, or may experience strong emotions
      and physical sensations.”<br>

    <h4>History of early development, illness and&nbsp; treatment planning</h4>
    If you choose to try EMDR therapy,&nbsp; your first session will likely
    involve the therapist taking an initial client history. <br>
    Your therapist will probably ask you about what have brought you into
    therapy like:<br>
    &nbsp;- your history of early developments<br>
    &nbsp;- your problems<br>
    &nbsp;- your behaviors<br>
    &nbsp;- your fear<br>
    &nbsp;- your history of illness <br>
    <br>
    One difference between EMDR and many other therapies is <br>
    you won’t be asked to discuss the traumatic event in detail.<br>
    Because the emotions and physical sensations surrounding the event are
    important,&nbsp; not the details about the event itself. <br>
    <br>
    Once the therapist has developed a treatment plan for you the process of
    EMDR can before.<br>

    <p>The assessment phase creates the groundwork for your actual EMDR
      therapy sessions. <br>
      Your therapist will ask you to identify three things:<br>
      <br>
      1. A specific scene or picture that best represents your traumatic event.
      <br>
      You probably have already discussed your target event in your first
      session. <br>
      At this point you will clarify visualize the trauma you experienced,
      including associated emotions and bodily sensations.<br>
      <br>
      2. A negative belief about yourself associated with the traumatic event.<br>
    </p>
    <p> For example:&nbsp; <br>
      &nbsp; “I am helpless.” <br>
      &nbsp; “I am worthless.”<br>
      &nbsp; “I am a bad person.”<br>
      and so on.<br>
      <br>
      3. A positive belief you would rather believe about yourself. <br>
      This positive belief should reflect what is appropriate in the present. <br>
      For example, suppose you survived an assault:<br>
      <br>
      negative belief: </p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; “I’m in danger.” <br>
      <br>
      You might replace it with the <br>
    </p>
    <p>positive belief: </p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; “I’m safe now.”</p>

 Desensitization is a method reducing irritability by getting closer to your
    unpleasure target step by step. <br>
    <br>
	In phases 4-6, rapid eye movement can be used.
	Choose a comfortable moving object, trajectory of the object and speed.
	In those phases,  you recall your target image while leading you through a series of rapid eye movements (tracking on the moving object by starting this app or alternating bilateral audio or tactile stimulation and or a combination thereof).
    <br>
    <br>
    With your attention split between the internal image you’re concentrating on
    and the external stimuli of the moving object on the screen, you’re able to
    experience the distressing memory while remaining grounded in the present,
    enabling you to process and re-frame the trauma.<br>
    <br>
    During the desensitization phase, you’ll pay attention to all the negative
    beliefs and disturbing emotions and bodily sensations that come up as you
    focus on your target image while following the moving object back and forth
    with your eyes. <br>
    <br>
    Please take note of all your reactions to the processing, good, bad, or
    neutral, …, including any new insights, associations, or emotions you
    experience.<br>
    <br>
    After each set of rapid eye movements, check in with you and assess your
    level of disturbance regarding the target image. <br>
    <br>
    During this process, you will continue to “digest” or process the feelings,
    images and beliefs that occur in relation to the trauma target. <br>
    <br>
    The desensitization phase continues until your distress level, as measured
    by the SUD scale, is reduced to 0 or 1.<br>

 In this installation phase, focus on the positive belief you’ve identified
    to replace your old negative belief about the trauma. <br>
    According to the <a href="http://www.emdrnetwork.org/">EMDR Network</a>,&nbsp;
    “positive self-beliefs are most important.” <br>
    <br>
    As in phase 4, you’ll concentrate on this mental image while simultaneously
    tracking the moving object with your eyes. <br>
    <br>
    The goal is to strengthen the positive belief or self-statement until you
    accept it as fully true.<br>
    After each set of rapid eye movements, rate the positive belief on the
    7-scale VOC, which gives the measures of how you are progressing. <br>
    <br>
    The installation phase is complete once you are able to accept the positive
    belief at a level of 7 (“completely true”).<br>
    <br>
    What is unique about EMDR is how rapidly new beliefs about the self and
    interpretations of the trauma replace old beliefs. <br>
    New possibilities emerge that were never before considered.<br>
    These new insights are used as the starting points for the next set of eye
    movements, continually helping you to process the trauma in healthier, more
    manageable ways.<br>

    In phase 5, you replaced negative beliefs surrounding the trauma with
    healthier, positive beliefs.<br>
    The next phase is to focus on any lingering physical sensations. <br>
    You imagine about your original target while scanning your body from head to
    toe, looking for residual tension. <br>
    <br>
    Any bodily tension or uncomfortable physical sensations are then targeted
    with bilateral stimulation until they are resolved.<br>
    <br>
    Phase 6 is considered successful when you are able to think or talk about
    the original target without feeling any body tension.<br>
    <br>
    Monitor the intensity of your symptoms between sessions <br>
    to ensure that progress is being made and maintained.<br>

    reprocessing a single trauma is generally accomplished within three

    <p>EMDR therapy is relatively new, developed in 1987, and the scientific
      community continues<br>
      to examine its long-term results. <br>
      While there are differing opinions on how effective this treatment really
      is, the main benefit of EMDR is the speed at which deep-seated problems
      can be resolved.<br>
      Single sessions of EMDR have been shown to produce results, and Dr.
      Francine Shapiro<br>
      reports an average treatment time of five sessions to comprehensively
      treat people with post-traumatic stress disorder.<br>
      To help you make your own decisions regarding EMDR, review the following
      list of reported<br>
      benefits and drawbacks.</p>
    <p>[Benefits]<br>
      &nbsp;- EMDR does not require you to go into detail about the distressing
      events of the past. <br>
      &nbsp;- Unlike many “talk” therapies, the trauma itself is not analyzed
      for long periods of time.<br>
      &nbsp;- EMDR simultaneously works on mind, body, and emotions.<br>
      &nbsp;- Its success in taking mere intellectual understanding of the
      origins of a problem. An intellectual understanding (e.g. “I know I have
      guilt over killing in the war”) is to a resolution where post-traumatic
      symptoms clear up.<br>
      &nbsp;- The trauma that must be re-experienced during treatment is
      relatively short-lived.<br>
      &nbsp;- Cognitive reprocessing occurs simultaneously with memory recall.<br>
      <br>
      [Drawbacks]<br>
      &nbsp;- EMDR has not been proven effective in studies on phobias, panic
      disorder or stress related disorders, only on PTSD.<br>
      &nbsp;- EMDR was created for use as a trauma therapy and as such focuses
      on intensely stressful subjects. <br>
      &nbsp;- Pregnant women, or those with heart conditions, eye problems, or
      other health issues should consult their doctor before beginning EMDR
      therapy.<br>
      &nbsp;- EMDR is a relatively new therapy and as such the verdict is still
      out as to its long-term effectiveness.</p>

    <p>There is a vigorous debate within the psychological community regarding
      the efficacy of EMDR, especially when compared with other types of
      therapy. <br>
      Those on both sides are passionate about their claims and present plenty
      of food for discussions.<br>
      Critics question the scientific validity of the method and the lack of
      data explaining how EMDR works. <br>
      On the other hand, numerous people have reported significant benefits from
      EMDR treatment, as have many studies published in peer-reviewed journals
      and papers. <br>
      Based on the encouraging results of these studies, in 1999, both the <a href="http://www.apa.org/">American
